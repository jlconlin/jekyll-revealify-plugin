# jekyll-revealify-plugin

This `jekyll-revealify-plugin` provides an easy way to incorporate
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) HTML slides into your
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website.

This repository contains a couple of things:

1. ready-to-distribute reveal.js code
2. a jekyll-revealify-plugin gem
3. chalkboard-redux, our chalkboarding plugin

For docs of the former, see <https://revealjs.com>---for the latter two,
<https://cs.anu.edu.au/pages/docs/gitlab-pages/docs/12-online-html-slides/>.

If you'd like a window into how exactly this plugin does it's job, then
[this](https://benswift.me/blog/2018/09/28/another-reveal.js-plugin-for-jekyll/)
is probably the best place to find it (although it might be a _bit_
out-of-date).
